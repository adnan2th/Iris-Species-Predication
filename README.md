# 🌸 Iris Species Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features:  
**Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.**

This project demonstrates supervised learning fundamentals, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment-ready code.
